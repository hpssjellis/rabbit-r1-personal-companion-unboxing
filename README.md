# rabbit-r1-personal-companion-unboxing



## My Rabbit R1 arrived May 8th, 2024

1. It feels really good, smaller than I thought it would be and solid, not heavy. Fits in my shirt pocket.
2. he case is very solid, I probably will leave it in my backpack.
3. Setup took about 20 minutes, needed WiFi and then an internet connection through the usb-c cable. Did three types of downloads.
