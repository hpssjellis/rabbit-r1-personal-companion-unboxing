Do you know what a LAM like rabbit.tech is?


ChatGPT
The Large Action Model (LAM) by rabbit.tech is a new type of foundational AI model that is designed to understand human intentions on computers. LAM is the cornerstone of rabbit OS, an AI-powered personalized operating system. This system allows users to interact with their devices using natural language instead of conventional apps and menus. rabbit OS can comprehend complex user intentions, operate user interfaces, and perform actions on behalf of the user.

The LAM continuously learns and imitates from aggregated demonstrations of users, enabling the OS to execute complex tasks on consumer interfaces efficiently. It does this in a humanizing way, without requiring the user to install applications or leverage specialized application programming interfaces (APIs). This approach aims to reimagine the relationship between humans and machines, making interaction with technology more intuitive and natural. The company envisions a world where technology enhances the human experience by creating a more interactive and responsive interface between man and machine​​.
